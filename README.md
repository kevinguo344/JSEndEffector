# Jenny Sabin Lab End-Effector

This is repo for the code to drive the ceramic extruder/end-effector for the ABB IRB 4600 45kg 2.05m robot arm at the Jenny Sabin Lab at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY

The end effector is powered by an Arduino board, which controls a 2HSS86H closed-loop stepper motor, which in turn drives a piston-based extruder mechanism for the motor.

More details to be shared in upcoming papers about Polybrick and Robosense from the JSLab.
